        <p>
            jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.[3] jQuery
            is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million
            highest-trafficked sites on the Web.[4][5][6]
            jQuery is free, open-source software licensed under the MIT License.[2]</p>
        <p>
            jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations,
            handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create
            plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library.
            This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and
            high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful
            dynamic web pages and Web applications.
